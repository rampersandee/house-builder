### Goal: Create a personal Express app that has two or more CRUD features.

### Process:

<ol>
  <li>The ideation for this project took the most time.</li>
  <li>But you know what?  I like to play games, so I figured it was time for another one.</li>
  <li>Concept is simple; get the tools to build the house.</li>
  <li>Once to user logs in; (CRUD method) 5 spans are generated with 5 items.  Along with those items are pluses to increment when an item is found.</li>
   <li>The user will click a button that randomizes from an array in the main.js that has an uneven distribution of the items that were generated ('nuts','wrench','saw','hammer','toolbox').</li>  
   <li>As soon as one of the words matches the items, the user will click on the 'plus' that matches the item.  When the user item number matches the number of tools required to build a house, the page alerts 'You have a house!'  Yay, you won!</li>
  <li>A delete method is used to clear the items so the user can play again.</li>
  <li>All in all, though, done and dusted.</li>

<p>Overall, I'm not quite done with this one.  I had an idea for a stopwatch to see how quickly the user could put the house together, but as the put method reloads the page, the stopwatch refreshes, but the CRUD is there!</p>

<ul>
  <li>I completed the challenge: | 5 <em>My CRUDs are in there; check 'em and see.</em></li>
  <li>I feel good about my code: | 3 <em>I feel like I could do a bit more with this.  It works, but it could be so much more, I really want the stopwatch so I could do a leaderboard.</em></li>
</ul>
